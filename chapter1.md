## Initializing our first App

Simply use this command in the desired folder.

```

```

## Testing the App

First open Android Studio Open the **AVD Manager**

Create a new Virtual Device or use one of your owns.

For my part I use:

Once your emulator started you can simply run the command:

```
react-native run-android
```

If you want to use IOS Simulator you can simply run the command:

    react-native run-ios
