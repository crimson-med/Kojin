# Introduction

---

## Etymology

Kojin comes from the Japanese god of fire \(Kojin-xxxxx\). This name was chosen for this documentation as we will mainly be using **Firebase**

## Requirements

We will be using

* React Native 0.50.4
* React Native FCM \(Firebase Cloud Messaging\)
* Firebase
* Android Studio
* npm

## Important Notice

> As for using notifications and debugging notifications on **IOS** can only be done on a real device \(thank you apple\) I will be using Android for the testing purposes.

## The Goal

In this document the goal is to see how through sending one notification through Firebase we can run specific function without having to handle intents.

> Simplicity is key
